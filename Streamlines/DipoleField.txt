Charged particles in a static magnetic field appear to be guided by magnetic field lines.  For example, in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2_wUDBl-g8 this video], the charged particles net motion is along the direction of the magnetic field.  On average, the particle does not move in the horizontal direction.

When iron filings are placed on a piece of paper near a magnetic field, the filings tend to align themself with the magnetic field direction [http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2011/09/magnetic-fields-iron-filings-flickr-oskay.jpg].

For these reasons, it is useful to draw streamlines associated with a magnetic vector field.

The following program creates magnetic field vectors associated with a dipole that is aligned in the z-direction.  The magnetic field in the y-direction is zero.

Starting with this program, write a program that draws a streamline that starts at the position (x,z) = (1,0).  A result for a streamline that starts at (x,z) = (1,1) is shown in the following image.

Extend this program so that on one plot streamlines are shown for starting positions of (x,z) = (1,0), (x,z) = (2,0), (x,z) = (3,0).
